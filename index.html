                  <h3>History of the Web; Once upon a time...</h3>
                    <p>Or in March 1989 to be more precise there was a guy named <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, he worked at <a href="https://home.cern/">CERN</a> (yes, exactly those guys from Supercolliders and God Particle) at that time, and seeing the potential of the fast growing internet, he decided to explore a new Technology called Hyper-Text. He showed his idea to his boss, who, as any other boss when faced with some super marvellous idea, said no. Or being more precise again, write on the cover of the project:</p> 
                    <blockquote>"Vague but exciting" - <a href="http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html">Mike Sendall</a> about the invention of the Internet.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Poor Tim only have time allocated to his project one year and a half later, in September 1990. Using the NeXt computer, Steve Jobs' product, in just one month he managed to create the three key technologies that shape the web today, <a href="#HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="#URI">URI</a> and <a href="#HTTP">HTTP</a>. In 1993 Tim convinced CERN to make all the <a href="http://line-mode.cern.ch/resources/">code</a> for the web available and royalty-free forever. Since 1994 Tim Berners-Lee is a founding member of <a class="internal link" href="#W3C"> World Wide Web Consortium(W3C)</a>.

                    <p>Hyper Text Markup Language or HTML, is the language used to give structure to web pages, HTML is not a programming language, you don't have a process that can be repeated in HTML, normally an HTML will be read once, from top to bottom and rendered by the browser. That being said, it's good to clear that you can use CSS and JavaScript "shenanigans" to influence how the page is going to appear, and even if some parts of HTML will be omitted based on the screen size or some pre established function.</p>
                    <p>The <span class="humility">beatifully written</span> HTML used to build this page is here:</p>

                    &lt;h3&gt;Hyper Text Markup Language, the how this assignment was writing&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Hyper Text Markup Language or HTML, is the language used to give structure to web pages, HTML is not a programming language, you don't have a process that can be repeated in HTML, normally an HTML will be read once, from top to bottom and rendered by the browser.

                    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="humility"&gt;beatifully written&lt;/span&gt; HTML used to build this page is here:&lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="inceptionSeparator"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;pre class="HtmlInceptionPre"&gt;&lt;code class="HtmlInceptionCode"&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;!-- The code Inside this &lt;pre&gt; tag is Pre Formatted and is rendered as writed (&lt;pre&gt; show every white space) so this part of the code is not indentented right on porpouse. --&gt;
                    &lt;div class="inceptionSeparator"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Talk about inception, Huh?&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/"&gt;28 October 2014&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="humility"&gt;Timothy Leary&lt;/span&gt;, I mean, Tim Berners-Lee and his friends in the W3C and WHATWG from Google, Apple and Microsoft (seeing the performance of IE, I'm sure this last guy was not paying any attention)  published a new major revision of HTML, this one being the fifth, together with all the promises that most of the changes this time are for good, that they will probably break in HTML6, they introduced a lot of features, recognizing for example CSS and JavaScript as the official Style and Script language of HTML. And the best part is that the alternative was XHTML, trust me here, this revision was great just for that reason alone.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;The whole package is known as HTML5, where you use the HTML to create the structure of the document, the CSS to make it look beautiful and finally the JavaScript to make it jump around, and creepily pin-point the location of your visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
                    
                &lt;/article&gt;
                &lt;article id="URI"&gt;
                    &lt;h3&gt;URI, URL or what you type to get to sites, when you are not searching&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;URI means Uniform Resource Identifier, and is a string of characters that are used to name or identify resources in the Web, it works like an address, and as in addresses the good ones cost more money. In the Real Estate realm of the web, organizations called NIC, for Network Information Center, affiliated to the governement initially own all domains from a sub domain, In Example the most common .com.br for Brasil, and .ie for Ireland. They set the rules as how to deal those domains, then some companies called registrars make agreements to have the right to deal those domains too, Like godaddy.com World wide, &lt;a href="http://registro.br/"&gt;registro.br in Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://register.ie/"&gt;register.ie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.hostingireland.ie/"&gt;Hostingireland.ie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.iedr.ie/register-a-domain/accredited-registrar-list/?ss=48&as="&gt;many many others to ireland.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;After you buy your domain, you need to setup where the DNS information for the domain will be. Most of the registrar offer DNS too, but if you have alot of domains in different regions, like .com ,.ie and .com.br as is my case, you may want to join everything under a DNS. The best option in my opinion is Afraid.org they are free and very reliable. To do this you first go to the registrar, and forward all the DNS traffic of this domain to afraid.org like this:&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;figure&gt;
                        &lt;img class="fullWImage" src="img/goDaddyDns.jpg" alt="Go Daddy DNS for HenriqueRodrigues.com"&gt;
                        &lt;figcaption&gt;The DNS records of HenriqueRodrigues.com in Godaddy.com The 4 records are set to 4 different Domain Name Servers kept by Afraid.org&lt;/figcaption&gt;
                    &lt;/figure&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;After you first set this up, every other DNS server now know that they need to ask the location of subdomains of henriquerodrigues.com to Afraid.org, and even is one of their server is down they could ask the other 3 in the list. But the actual html to henriquerodrigues.com is not hosted in Afraid.org, so now what?&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Now we configure the servers of afraid.org to tell where the sub domain is, the sub domain being the first part of the url, for example the www. in http://&lt;span class="highLightThis"&gt;www.&lt;/span&gt;henriquerodrigues.com is the subdomain here, you can even configure the domain without a subdomain to point somewhere http://henriquerodrigues.com the example is here:&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;figure&gt;
                        &lt;img src="img/afraidDns.jpg" alt="Afraid DNS records for HenriqueRodrigues.com Subdomain"&gt;
                        &lt;figcaption&gt;This is the DNS records for henriquerodrigues.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;                        
                    &lt;/figure&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;You can see that the A (&lt;a href="https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/a-record/"&gt;from Address&lt;/a&gt;) Records are pointing to a IPv4 Address, and that the FTP, mail and irc aren't configured yet, There is a MX record pointing to Google Gmail Servers but that is history to another day.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Ok! Great, now we are all set right? Wrong! This only means that the traffic will be redirected to the servers, but we need something in the otherside to understand the requests and give the right replies, we need Apache!, the software type, not the Indian type&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;figure&gt;
                        &lt;img src="img/apacheIndian.jpg" alt="Apache Indian"&gt;
                        &lt;figcaption&gt;Geronimo disapproves the last joke. And yes, &lt;a href="http://nativeamerican-art.com/apache-clothing.html"&gt;his name is Geronimo.&lt;/a&gt; I'm not being racist here.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
                    &lt;/figure&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;If you have a CentOs as in my case, it's very easy to configure Apache, first you install everything, and I mean everything as you can see Apache dependencies: &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;code&gt;# repoquery --requires httpd&lt;/code&gt;

                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/bin/bash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/etc/mime.types&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/sbin/useradd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;apr-util-ldap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;chkconfig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;You will probably need Mysqld, PHP and Curl, and all the dependencies if you plan in doing anything useful with the web server but lets pretend we don't.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;After installing everything, its time to type some very basic and intuitive commands in the console as:&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;code&gt;sudo vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf&lt;/code&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;And then edit a very very &lt;!-- TODO: Tell Anthony the next TODO: is not meant to be a comment --&gt;/*"TODO:Insert Adjective here"*/ 1272 lines of code document, to let Apache reply to the browsers requests, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;figure&gt;
                    &lt;img src="img/virtualHostsApache.jpg" alt = "My Httpd.conf for virtual hosts"&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption&gt;The httpd.conf configuration of my server&lt;/figcaption&gt;
                    &lt;/figure&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;But don't even sweet, the worst that can happen if you mess something up, is that a very concerned &lt;a href="https://www.nsa.gov/"&gt;NSA Agent&lt;/a&gt; will knock on your door asking questions about that time you helped the terrorists DDoS a Surveilance Sattelite Down. It was a monday.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Now you can see my Assigment here: &lt;a href="http://www.henriquerodrigues.com/griffith/cwd/assigment2/"&gt;http://www.henriquerodrigues.com/griffith/cwd/assigment2/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, you have alternatives to Apache, Microsoft &lt;span class="highLightThis"&gt;IIS&lt;/span&gt; is one, that is &lt;span class="highLightThis"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;nfinitly more expensive and &lt;a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-26/product_id-3436/Microsoft-IIS.html"&gt;&lt;span class="highLightThis"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n&lt;span class="highLightThis"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ecure&lt;/a&gt;, Infinity here is not a Hiperbole, Apache is a Free software running probably in a free Operation System, IIS is not, so don't use IIS, &lt;a href="https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2016/02/22/february-2016-web-server-survey.html"&gt;no one does&lt;/a&gt;. Use Apache, don't disapoint Geronimo again.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h3&gt;Hyper Text Transfer Protocol or how computers talk so you can see more pictures about cats&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;So if you are reading this from top to bottom, and I really don't envy you fot this, we already talked about what happens when the computers communicate and some configurations that let the communication happen, now lets talk about the language that they communicate via the internet so your browser can render Web Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;In this protocol, computers communicate by packets, in a process that look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;figure&gt;

                    &lt;/figure&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;And those Requests look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;This was header of the server response, in the first line it replied HTTP/1.1 (The version of the protocol) and 304 that mean the page was not modified since the date especified in the request, if it was, the browser would reply with a header very similar to this, with a number &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html"&gt;2xx instead of the 304,&lt;/a&gt; meaning sucess and with the HTML for this page above the header. &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;This is how computer communicate to deliver webpages. They only do that over and over, for every image, css, javascript, html and font-family that the browser show&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;So finally lets talk more about W3C or World Wide Web Consortium, the guys that make the standards for the web and try really hard to please everyone. Since Tim Berners-Lee founded it as you can see in the &lt;a href="#History" class="internalLinks"&gt;history part of this page&lt;/a&gt; the W3C growth to a very important organization, today they try to all the big companies that play a key factor in the web, and the users to be able to make good decisions, and they play the biggest role in trying to make the life of web developers, web users and companies that produce good browsers as easy as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;They &lt;a href="https://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/"&gt;make decisions about&lt;/a&gt; (I checked the list on the link but actually copied it from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;li&gt;XPath&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;XQuery&lt;/li&gt;

                        &lt;li&gt;WSDL&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;XForms&lt;/li&gt;


                    &lt;/ul&gt;
                    &lt;p class="clearThis"&gt;You can see HTML, CSS and DOM, that is used in JavaScript alot, in the list. They are done with HTTP, this meaning they think HTTP is ok and there is no need to mess with it anymore since &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;So they create rules and build tools that help people obey that rules (what a lesson for some governments). One of this tools is the &lt;a href="https://validator.w3.org/"&gt;W3C HTML Validator&lt;/a&gt;, that is showing me 4 erros in the incomplete web version of this site right now, but that is because I'm a moron trying to insert a ordered list inside the code tag &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5681481/should-ol-ul-be-inside-p-or-outside"&gt;which is not possible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, the W3C create standards, and that is good, almost every one like them, some pirates have &lt;a href="https://defectivebydesign.org/blog/tim_bernerslee_created_sold_out_web"&gt;1.mixed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.defectivebydesign.org/blog/tim_bernerslee_just_gave_us_opening_stop_drm_web_standards"&gt;2.feelings&lt;/a&gt;, but that is ok if you created the web, and your &lt;a href="http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/tim-berners-lee-net-worth/"&gt;networth&lt;/a&gt; is less than half of what &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2016/06/09/googles-larry-page-is-spending-100-million-to-build-flying-cars/#536785b15855"&gt;Larry Page spent on cars&lt;/a&gt;, and you spent your time pondering how many clicks is &lt;a href="http://www.computerworlduk.com/it-business/tim-bernerslee-on-why-html5-needs-drm-3569417/"&gt;acceptable to steal&lt;/a&gt; a movie from Netflix, you are probably ok.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/article&gt;
            &lt;/section&gt;

                &lt;h4&gt;The colors selection process of this site&lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The color where selected from &lt;a href="http://paletton.com/"&gt;Palleton&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href="http://www.tigercolor.com/color-lab/color-theory/color-harmonies.htm"&gt;Complementary Color Triad &lt;/a&gt;. The colors selected where based on &lt;a href="http://www.vggallery.com/painting/p_0467.htm"&gt;Cafe Terrace on the Place du Forum, Arles, at Night from Vincent van Gogh&lt;/a&gt; all colors can be found in the screen, I just added more saturation.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <p>Talk about inception, Huh?</p>
                    <p>In <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">28 October 2014</a> <span class="humility">Timothy Leary</span>, I mean, Tim Berners-Lee and his friends in the W3C and WHATWG from Google, Apple and Microsoft (seeing the performance of IE, I'm sure this last guy was not paying any attention)  published a new major revision of HTML, this one being the fifth, together with all the promises that most of the changes this time are for good, that they will probably break in HTML6, they introduced a lot of features, recognizing for example CSS and JavaScript as the official Style and Script language of HTML. And the best part is that the alternative was XHTML, trust me here, this revision was great just for that reason alone.</p>
                    <p>The whole package is known as HTML5, where you use the HTML to create the structure of the document, the CSS to make it look beautiful and finally the JavaScript to make it jump around, and creepily pin-point the location of your visitors.</p>
                    
                </article>
                <article id="URI">
                    <h3>URI, URL or what you type to get to sites, when you are not searching</h3>
                    <p>URI means Uniform Resource Identifier, and is a string of characters that are used to name or identify resources in the Web, it works like an address, and as in addresses the good ones cost more money. In the Real Estate realm of the web, organizations called NIC, for Network Information Center, affiliated to the governement initially own all domains from a sub domain, In Example the most common .com.br for Brasil, and .ie for Ireland. They set the rules as how to deal those domains, then some companies called registrars make agreements to have the right to deal those domains too, Like godaddy.com World wide, <a href="http://registro.br/">registro.br in Brazil</a> and <a href="https://register.ie/">register.ie</a>, <a href="https://www.hostingireland.ie/">Hostingireland.ie</a> and <a href="https://www.iedr.ie/register-a-domain/accredited-registrar-list/?ss=48&as=">many many others to ireland.</a></p>
                    <p>After you buy your domain, you need to setup where the DNS information for the domain will be. Most of the registrar offer DNS too, but if you have alot of domains in different regions, like .com ,.ie and .com.br as is my case, you may want to join everything under a DNS. The best option in my opinion is Afraid.org they are free and very reliable. To do this you first go to the registrar, and forward all the DNS traffic of this domain to afraid.org like this:</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="fullWImage" src="img/goDaddyDns.jpg" alt="Go Daddy DNS for HenriqueRodrigues.com">
                        <figcaption>The DNS records of HenriqueRodrigues.com in Godaddy.com The 4 records are set to 4 different Domain Name Servers kept by Afraid.org</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>After you first set this up, every other DNS server now know that they need to ask the location of subdomains of henriquerodrigues.com to Afraid.org, and even is one of their server is down they could ask the other 3 in the list. But the actual HTML to henriquerodrigues.com is not hosted in Afraid.org, so now what?</p>
                    <p>Now we configure the servers of afraid.org to tell where the sub domain is, the sub domain being the first part of the url, for example the www. in http://<span class="highLightThis">www.</span>henriquerodrigues.com is the subdomain here, you can even configure the domain without a subdomain to point somewhere http://henriquerodrigues.com the example is here:</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/afraidDns.jpg" alt="Afraid DNS records for HenriqueRodrigues.com Subdomain">
                        <figcaption>This is the DNS records for henriquerodrigues.com</figcaption>                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>You can see that the A (<a href="https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/a-record/">from Address</a>) Records are pointing to a IPv4 Address, and that the FTP, mail and irc aren't configured yet, There is a MX record pointing to Google Gmail Servers but that is history to another day.</p>
                    <p>Ok! Great, now we are all set right? Wrong! This only means that the traffic will be redirected to the servers, but we need something in the otherside to understand the requests and give the right replies, we need Apache!, the software type, not the Indian type</p>
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>If you have a CentOs as in my case, it's very easy to configure Apache, first you install everything, and I mean everything as you can see Apache dependencies: </p>

                    <p>After installing everything, its time to type some very basic and intuitive commands in the console as:</p>

                    <p>So if you are reading this from top to bottom, and I really don't envy you fot this, we already talked about what happens when the computers communicate and some configurations that let the communication happen, now lets talk about the language that they communicate via the internet so your browser can render Web Pages.</p>
                    <p>In this protocol, computers communicate by packets, in a process that look like this:</p>

                    <p>This was header of the server response, in the first line it replied HTTP/1.1 (The version of the protocol) and 304 that mean the page was not modified since the date especified in the request, if it was, the browser would reply with a header very similar to this, with a number <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">2xx instead of the 304,</a> meaning sucess and with the HTML for this page above the header. </p>

                    <p class="clearThis">You can see <a href="#HTML" class="internalLinks">HTML</a>, CSS and DOM that is how JavaScript change HTML, in the list. They are done with <a href="#URI" class="internalLinks">HTTP</a>, this meaning they think HTTP is ok and there is no need to mess with it anymore since <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/">2014</a></p>
                    <p>So they create rules and build tools that help people obey that rules (what a lesson for some governments). One of this tools is the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML Validator</a>, that is showing me 4 erros in the incomplete web version of this site right now, but that is because I'm a moron trying to insert a ordered list inside the code tag <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5681481/should-ol-ul-be-inside-p-or-outside">which is not possible</a>.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, the W3C create standards, and that is good, almost every one like them, some pirates have <a href="https://defectivebydesign.org/blog/tim_bernerslee_created_sold_out_web">1.mixed</a> <a href="https://www.defectivebydesign.org/blog/tim_bernerslee_just_gave_us_opening_stop_drm_web_standards">2.feelings</a>, but that is ok if you created the web, and your <a href="http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/tim-berners-lee-net-worth/">networth</a> is less than half of what <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2016/06/09/googles-larry-page-is-spending-100-million-to-build-flying-cars/#536785b15855">Larry Page spent on cars</a>, and you spent your time pondering how many clicks is <a href="http://www.computerworlduk.com/it-business/tim-bernerslee-on-why-html5-needs-drm-3569417/">acceptable to steal</a> a movie from Netflix, you are probably ok.</p>
